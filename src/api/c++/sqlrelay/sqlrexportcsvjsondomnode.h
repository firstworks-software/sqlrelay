		 *  =====================
		 *  0,0.0,field00,field01
		 *  1,1.1,field10,field11

		 *  <h t="a">

		 *    <v t="s" v="col2"/>
		 *    <v t="s" v="col3"/>

		 *    <v t="n" v="1.1"/>
		 *    <v t="s" v="field10"/>
		 *    <v t="s" v="field11"/>
		 *  </r>
		 *
		 *  This format is similar to the DOM tree that the rudiments
		 *  class csvdom defines to represent a CSV, though it uses the
		 *  rules defined for representing JSON by the rudiments class
		 *  jsondom.
		 *
		 *  It consists of a "h"(eader) array, each "v"(alue) of which
		 *  contains a "t"(ype) attribute of either "s"(tring) or
		 *  "n"(umber) and a "v"(alue) attribute containing the column
		 *  name.
		 *
		 *  It also consists of "r"(ecord) arrays, each "v"(alue)
		 *  of which also contains a "t"(ype) attribute of either
		 *  "s"(tring) or "n"(umber) and a "v"(alue).
		 *
		 *  The "h"(eader) and "r"(ecord) nodes are inspired by the
		 *  CSV representation defined by csvdom, but the nodes of the
		 *  tree are all consistent with the JSON representation
		 *  defined by jsondom.  As such, the tree can be operated on
		 *  by methods that can operate on a jsondom tree.
		 *
		 *  Note that since there is no tag representing the set of
		 *  records/rows, rather the tag for an each record/row is just
		 *  appended to the top-level tag, there is no "rows domnode".
		 *  As such, this method never calls setRowsDomNode(), and
		 *  getRowsDomNode() always return NULL.
		 *
		 *  Returns true on success and false if an error occurred. */
